# Purpose
Store and submit all 4 projects for COE379 - Software Design for Responsible Intelligent Systems

## Project 1 - Fuel Efficiency Linear Regression Model 
The purpose of this project was to create a linear regression model based on least squared method. Throughout this project I prepared and analyzed the data, split the data into a training and test set, fit the data to the linear regression model, and evaluated its accuracy. In the end we ended up with an R2 score of 0.834. More detail can be foud the in report (.pdf).

## Project 2 - Breast Cancer Recurrence Classification Models
The purpose of this model was to determine the best model for predicting if a patient was likely to have a recurrence event for breast cancer. In this project 3 models were built: Random Forest, K-Neares Neighbor, and Multinomial Naive Bayes. Throughout this project I prepared and analyzed the data, split the data into training and test set, fit the data to the different models, and evaluated their performance using different metrics. The models in this project were optimized for maximizing recall using sklearn grid search function. More detail can be found in the report (.pdf).
