# Fuel Efficiency Linear Regression Model 
The purpose of this project was to create a linear regression model based on least squared method. Throughout this project I prepared and analyzed the data, split the data into a training and test set, fit the data to the linear regression model, and evaluated its accuracy. In the end we ended up with an R2 score of 0.834.
